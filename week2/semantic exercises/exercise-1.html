        <h1>The Ultimate Productivity Hack is Saying No</h1>
        <p>
          The ultimate productivity hack is saying no. Not doing something will
          always be faster than doing it. This statement reminds me of the old
          computer programming saying,
          <em>“Remember that there is no code faster than no code.”</em> The
          same philosophy applies in other areas of life. For example, there is
          no meeting that goes faster than not having a meeting at all. This is
          not to say you should never attend another meeting, but the truth is
          that we say yes to many things we don't actually want to do. There are
          many meetings held that don't need to be held. There is a lot of code
          written that could be deleted. How often do people ask you to do
          something and you just reply, “Sure thing.” Three days later, you're
          overwhelmed by how much is on your to-do list.

        <h1>What I Do When I Feel Like Giving Up</h1>
        <p>
          I am struggling today. If you’ve ever struggled to be
          <em>consistent</em> with something you care about, maybe my struggle
          will resonate with you too. It has been 939 days since November 12,
          2012. That’s the date when I first published an article on
          JamesClear.com and it’s almost 2 years and 7 months ago. During these
          939 mostly glorious, sometimes frustrating days, I have written a new
          post every Monday and Thursday. Week after week. Month after month.
          Year after year.

        <h1>7 Ways to Retain More of Every Book You Read</h1>
        <p>
          There are many benefits to reading more books, but perhaps my favorite
          is this:
          <em
            >A good book can give you a new way to interpret your past
            experiences.</em
          >
          Whenever you learn a new mental model or idea, it's like the
          “software” in your brain gets updated. Suddenly, you can run all of
          your old data points through a new program. You can learn new lessons
          from old moments. As Patrick O'Shaughnessy says, “Reading changes the
          past.” Of course, this is only true if you internalize and remember
          insights from the books you read. Knowledge will only compound if it
          is retained. In other words, what matters is not simply reading more
          books, but getting more out of each book you read. Gaining knowledge
          is not the only reason to read, of course. Reading for pleasure or
          entertainment can be a wonderful use of time, but this article is
          about reading to learn. With that in mind, I'd like to share some of
          the best reading comprehension strategies I’ve found.
